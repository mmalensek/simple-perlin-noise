# Implementation of own game terrain generator based on Perlin Noise

Implementation my own version of the Perlin noise. Perlin noise is a type of gradient noise developed by Ken Perlin in 1983, commonly used in computer graphics to create smooth, natural-looking textures and procedural terrain by generating pseudo-random patterns with gradual transitions. In my case I have decided to create a simple 2D procedurally generated image simulating a simple world filled with lakes, fields and snowy mountains.
